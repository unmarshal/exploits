= Exploit Collection =

Here is a collection of exploits I wrote under the moniker 'bind' in the late 90s to early 00s. I am releasing these just to show what things were like during that hacking era. I doubt these are useful anymore but some of the techniques and coding style are valuable and entertaining to look at.

== The exploits ==

_ipop2ex_

This was the first stack overflow exploit I wrote in 1999.

`Details: A buffer overflow exists in the pop2 server distributed
with imap packages 4.4 and earlier. Exploitation of this bug allows
remote access to the machine with the user id of nobody. This program
allows you to exploit pop2 without the need of a third party IMAP server.
If you are behind a firewall, resort to using a third party, internet
routable IMAP server.  For accuracy purposes, this exploit autodetects
the version of the server it is exploiting and performs alignment calculation.`
